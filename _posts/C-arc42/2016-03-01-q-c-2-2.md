Three major types of constraints exist:

* Organizational constraints: E.g. compliance to (standard) processes, budget, time, required information flows, required (management) reporting structures, adherence to certain documentation templates or conventions...
* Technical constraints: Usage of specific hardware, middleware, software-components, adherence
to specific technical or architectural decisions (e.g. use of specific frameworks or libraries)
* Conventions, e.g. programming style, naming conventions or similar stuff.
