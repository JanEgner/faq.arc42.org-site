Create a blog (RSS-feed) and write a brief entry for your important decisions. Tag those with labels (e.g.: frontend, backend, SAP-interface or similar), so stakeholders can _filter_ them.

Such a blog shows the history of your system quite well. You can combine
the blog with the idea of _architecture decision records_ (see [question C-9-3](/questions/C-9-3)).
