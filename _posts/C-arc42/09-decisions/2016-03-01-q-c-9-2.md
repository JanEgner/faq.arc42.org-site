You have several options, shown in order of increasing effort and degree-of-detail:


* Write a blog for your decisions, every decisions becomes a blog post.
* Use a text format similar to an (Alexandrian) pattern, like explained in [question C-9-3 (Architecture Decision Record)](/questions/C-9-3).
* For important decisions, the following topics might be interesting:
  * subject of the decision
  * affected stakeholders
  * decision criteria (with priorities)
  * alternatives
  * evaluation of alternatives for the various criteria
  * who took the decision?
  * reason for chosing _this_ alternative in favor of others
