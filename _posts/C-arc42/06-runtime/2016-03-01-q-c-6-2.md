Show _how_ the system executes, the _dynamics_ of the system, its _behavior_ in terms of its building blocks.

The following types of scenarios might be relevant for you:

* The most important use cases, features or functions
*	System startup
*	The systems´ behavior on its most important external interfaces
* The systems´ behavior in important error or failure situations

>It's important that the runtime view shows **which building block** is responsible for **what activities** or functions within the system. Therefore the mapping of (static) blocks to activities, process steps, functions or other dynamic elements is important.
