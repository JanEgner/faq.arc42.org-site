Partial scenarios describe parts or extracts of complete scenarios or processes. They show only interesting, difficult, risky or important aspects of some _greater_ process.

Concentrating on these _essentials_ brings several benefits:

* You avoid trivial parts of scenarios
* You work more economically by leaving out unnecessary, non-important or low-priority aspects. That saves time/effort in creating and maintaining documentation!
* Smaller scenarios might be easier to understand (if (!) you make very clear which parts of the overall scenario you left out!)

A risk of partial scenarios might be consumers that don't understand the prerequisites or preconditions of a partial scenario. Use annotations within your diagrams to explicitly clarify such required knowledge or facts.

In the figure shown below, you find a complete scenario first, and a nice partial scenario as an extract afterwards.

As you see, the first interactions seem quite trivial. Therefore, we can simple leave them out in a partial scenario:
