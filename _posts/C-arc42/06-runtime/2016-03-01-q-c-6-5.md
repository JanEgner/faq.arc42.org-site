The following types of scenarios are candidates for runtime scenarios:

* The general case (aka the _rule_) of the most important use cases, features or functions.
* Important interactions with external systems, neighbors or user categories.
* Dynamic behavior of important external interfaces.
* Interactions that affect important quality goals or requirements.
* Error or failure conditions that might influence overall system behavior.
* Bootstrap-, startup or shutdown procedures, especially in distributed systems.
* Interactions that somehow deviate from _normal_ stakeholder expectation, especially deviate from developer expectation.
* Interactions that work in non-standard ways.
* Scenarios or processes that are subject to timing constraints
