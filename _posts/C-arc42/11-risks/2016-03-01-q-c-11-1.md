**Short answer**: The currently known problems.

#### Longer answer

The known risks (things that might become problems) and problems in the system, its related organizational, operational and development processes. They can refer to source code, structures, concepts,
decisions and all other aspects of the system.


>It's useful for development teams to have an overview of currently known risks and problems, so it can actively _manage_ the development and evolution of the system.
