This is the opposite of [question C-5-12 (blocks you don't need to document)](/questions/C-5-12).

#### Focus on important building blocks

You should document or specify the following kinds of building blocks:

* The level-1 whitebox (aka the **top-level decomposition** of your system).
* Blocks that address **important quality attributes** of the system.
* Blocks addressing specific or important functionality.
* Blocks that handle **complicated** or **complex** functionality.
* Blocks that mitigate or handle **risks**.
* Blocks that contain surprises or **unusual** ideas.
* Blocks that **somehow deviate** from the rest of the system.
* Blocks that deviate from typical developers' expectation.
* Blocks that are required or important for **creating business value**.


#### Focus on higher-level building blocks.
Level-1 should always be documented.     


Remember to be lazy and document economically: Smaller documentation for fewer building blocks are easier and cheaper to maintain than large documentation for many blocks...
