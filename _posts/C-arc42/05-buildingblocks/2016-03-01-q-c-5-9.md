Basically similar to internal interfaces (see [question C-5-8 (internal interfaces)](/questions/C-5-8)).

The major distinction might be the fact that _external_ people (beyond the scope and influence of your systems' stakeholders) can be involved, both as consumers and as providers of interfaces (or data or events at these interfaces).

As these _external_ people will likely not have access to your internal arc42 documentation, you might be required to provide distinct documents for your external interfaces.

>Therefore external interfaces contain greater risks than internal interfaces, and they need more attention, care and management. As software architect, these _pesky_ things belong to your responsibility.
