#### Short answer

In general, limit building blocks to _things_ you implement or maintain yourself.

#### Longer answer

Some external software (like middleware, database, UI-toolkit or similar) might be essential to understanding the structure of your system. You can include those in the building block view - if they are required for understanding.

You definitely should show those elements in the deployment view (arc42-section 7)!.
