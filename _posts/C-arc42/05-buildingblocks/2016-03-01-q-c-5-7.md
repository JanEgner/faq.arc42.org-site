Wether object-oriented, procedural, functional or any other
programming paradigm: Building blocks are an abstraction of your
source code. You shall primarily describe or specify their
respective _responsibilities_ (and a few other details).

arc42 does **not** depend on a particular development approach or
programming paradigm...

For other hints to describe or specify building block structures, see [question C-5-6 (document building blocks)](/questions/C-5-6).
