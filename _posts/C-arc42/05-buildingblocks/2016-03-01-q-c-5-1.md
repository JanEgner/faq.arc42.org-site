#### Short answer

An abstraction of the source code of your system.

#### Longer answer

Any _programming_ or source code construct (e.g. module, component, subsystem, class, interface, package, library, framework, layer, partition, tier, function, macro, operation, data structure, â€¦) that you implemented to make your system work.

Further examples of building blocks which _might_ be relevant for your system:

* _configuration_ files or items
* UI specific files, styles or definitions, like css-files in web development.
* Any kind of templates used to generate other artifacts at compile-, build- or runtime
* Build- or makefiles
* Deployment- or installation-related artifacts (e.g. deployment- or container descriptors)

>Usually you should stick to _larger_ building blocks, like subsystems, top-level packages etc. Refrain from describing too many details.
