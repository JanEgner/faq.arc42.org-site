Some ideas:

* Reduce precision or the amount of detail you show in the business context.
Show abstractions, aggregate neighbors or even interfaces.
* Show categories (or clusters) of neighbors, not every single neighbor system.
* Use UML port symbols on a component diagram to avoid drawing too many boxes and
lines
* Combine multiple types of users or user-roles into appropriate abstractions
or more generic roles (e.g. combine private and corporate users simply into “users”).
