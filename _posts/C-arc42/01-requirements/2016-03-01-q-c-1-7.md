## System often have _many_ quality requirements

In real-world systems we often find >100 different quality scenarios,
way too many to digest _all-at-once_. That's why arc42 proposes
to split those in two parts:

* arc42 section 1.2 contains the high-priority quality requirements
* arc42 section 10 contains _the rest_, structured as a quality tree.

See the following diagram for an overview:
