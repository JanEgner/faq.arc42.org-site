Although we proposed (in  [question C-1-1 (describe requirements)](/questions/C-1-1))
to describe requirements only briefly (and refer to existing requirements
  documentation...) - there might be different cases.

Document requirements more extensively for systems:

* where some (unconspicious) requirements have _huge_ impact on
certain architecture decisions,
* with complex or extensive business requirements,
* without an existing (and reasonable) requirements documentation
