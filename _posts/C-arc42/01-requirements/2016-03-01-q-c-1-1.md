Detailed enough that readers of your (architecture) documentation can understand
why the system exists and what its major/fundamental requirements are.

* Briefly explain the major (max 3-5) use-cases, features or functions.
* Document the top 3-5 quality requirements by showing scenarios (see [question C-10-2 (quality scenarios)](/questions/C-10-2)).
* Make sure the most important domain terms are commonly understood
among the development team (arc42 provides a glossary section for that purpose,
  but you better let your product owner or other stakeholders create and maintain
  those definitions.)
* Link to additional requirements documentation, if it exists.
