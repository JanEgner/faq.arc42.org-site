What documents, artifacts, deliverables, reports or other means of
communication do stakeholders expect or require from the architecture
or development team?

> Please don't confuse this with the _system requirements_.

Some examples might clarify the term:

* Developers of the `fooBar`external interface might expect
a detailed description with sample data and code snippets,
so they know how to implement this interface (explained
  in the building block view, arc42 section 5).
* All developers need to know how the system stores cost-relevant
`furps`data into our auto-replicated NoSQL datastore (most likely
  explained in on of the crosscutting concepts in arc42 section 8)  
* The product owner calls for a _decision log_ of architecturally relevant decisions (arc42 section 9).
* Operation or administration need to know technical detail
of the required database and middleware configuration.
