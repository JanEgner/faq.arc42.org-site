**Bold** information should be present, the other parts are optional.


|Information   |Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
|**Name/Role** | who or which part of an organization has an interest in the system or its architecture? Sometimes you name specific people, quite often you'll stick to roles |
|--------------|---------|
|Knowledge |What do these stakeholders know about the system or its  associated processes?
|--------------|---------|
|**Expected deliverables** |What do these stakeholders expect from the architecture or its documentation? Please don't confuse this with the _system requirements_. See [question C-1-5 (deliverables)](/questions/C-1-5) below. |
|--------------|---------|
|_Relevance_ (priority)  | This is critical information: Some stakeholders will be relevant or required for production acceptance or sign-off - but: Explicitly stating relevance or priority might frustrate, irritate or even instigate those with lower priorities... You need to consider the _political_ consequences of putting this information in your documentation - but the team should definitely know about stakeholders' relevance.  |
|--------------|---------|
|**Contact** |As trivial as a phone number or email address, so you or the team can contact this stakeholder. |
|--------------|---------|
|Comment |Any other information people might need concerning this stakeholder. |
