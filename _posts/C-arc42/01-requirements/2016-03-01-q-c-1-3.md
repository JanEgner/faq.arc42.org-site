It's really important to know (not only guess) about the stakeholders of your system:

1. System stakeholders are potential consumers of information about the software or system architecture.
2. Several of the stakeholders might impose quality requirements on the system, that the development team needs to know about.
3. Architecture stakeholders are sometimes _forgotten_ during conventional requirements analysis, e.g. dev-teams of external interfaces, auditors
or developers themselves - these people or organizations will not have
requirements concerning the system itself, but its architecture or
architecture documentation.
4. Stakeholders are the most important source for any kind of feedback
that can help you and the development team to evolve and improve the architecture...
