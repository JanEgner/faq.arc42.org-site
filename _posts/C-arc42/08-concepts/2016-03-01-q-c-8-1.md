We use the term "concept" for rules, principles or other
decisions, guidelines, processes that influence one or more
elements of the architecture.

* Decisions, or concepts that cannot adequatly be assigned to a single building block
* Decisions or rules that influence several:
  * building blocks
  * parts of the implementation
  * runtime scenarios
  * interfaces
  * several developers
