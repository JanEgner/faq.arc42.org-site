title: "Question C-8-2: Our arc42 section 8 (on concepts) is a melting pot of information we couldn't put elsewhere? How can we keep an overview?"

The variety of topics in section 8 might seem chaotic, but all topics contained have something in common: They are all _crosscutting_ (for an explanation, see [question C-8-1 (what is crosscutting)](/questions/C-8-1)).

You shall remove (!) all concepts not relevant for your system (see [question C-8-3 (deal with many concepts)](/questions/C-8-3)).

Then you can group/order the remaining topics, either to system-specific criteria or after the following proposal (based upon ideas by Stefan Zörner):

* **Business or domain aspects**: domain, entity or data models, the ubiquitous language from domain-driven design 
* **Architectural patterns**: What (recurring) patterns have been applied, and how?
* **Development**: Build and build management, code generation, configuration, (automated) testing, migration
* **Interactions with users or external systems**: user interface aspects, i18n, validation, accessibility, communication, integration
* **Under the hood**: persistence, distribution, transactions, session-handling, caching, threading, exception and error handling, security
* **Operations**: deployment, installation, monitoring
