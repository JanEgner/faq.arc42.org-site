Such constraints are often imposed by organizations across multiple IT systems.

Examples:

* System has to be operated by data-center XYZ, as our company has
a long-term contract with them.
* Part of software/hardware development has to be off-shored to our Asian subdivision.
* Our operational database system needs to be IBM DB2.
* System has to be implemented in Java.

Please consider also questions [C-2-2](#q-C-2-2), [C-2-3](#q-C-2-2) and [C-2-4](#q-C-2-2).
