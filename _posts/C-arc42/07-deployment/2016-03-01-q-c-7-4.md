The UML provides only this type of diagram for deployment and infrastructure, therefore you have no practical alternative.

On the other hand, you can of course use any free form of diagram to depict your technical infrastructure.

Make sure that stakeholders understand such notations - and that architecture- and infrastructure decisions can be understood based upon these diagrams.

>Please add textual explanation (e.g. a table!) to your diagrams, where you briefly explain the elements, their responsibility and any additional information that is required to understand the situation.

#### Explain reasons

Often it will be useful to _reason_ about the diagram: Explain _why_ the structure shown is useful and what argumentation lead to the appropriate decisions.
