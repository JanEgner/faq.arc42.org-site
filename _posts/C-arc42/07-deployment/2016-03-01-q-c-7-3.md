Potentially you have two different author (groups), caring for the two different
aspects of the deployment view (see question [C-7-1 (deployment)](/questions/C-7-1)).

The first part of the deployment view, (technical infrastructure) will sometimes be created and maintained by stakeholders responsible for this technical infrastructure and/or hardware.

The second part, the mapping of software to hardware, will often be documented and maintained by architects and/or the development team.
