Should some constraints prove to be especially **unfavorable**, **risky** or
even **expensive** for your system or its development, you should definitely try to negotiate them.


An example: Let's say the company-wide constraint is: "Our software has to be developed in Java".
One of your tasks is the development of a specific smart-card reader, including
the appropriate hardware device driver - you should convince your management that such software
is better written in either C, Forth or Lua.
