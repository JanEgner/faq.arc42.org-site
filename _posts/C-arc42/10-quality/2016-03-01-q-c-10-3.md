(syn: quality attribute utility tree). A hierarchical model to describe
product quality: The root "quality" is hierarchically refined in _areas_ or
topics, which itself are refined again. Quality scenarios form the leaves of
these tree.

* Standards for product quality, like ISO 25010, propose _generic_ quality trees. You find this _generic_ quality tree in [question C-1-2 (quality goals)](/questions/C-1-2).
* The quality of a specific system can be described by a _specific_ quality tree (see the example below).
