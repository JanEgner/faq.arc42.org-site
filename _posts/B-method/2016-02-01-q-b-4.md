**Short answer**

: There is no general rule - as the minimal amount depends on the system, its stakeholders, criticality, complexity, size and/or risks.

**Longer answer**

: We suggest to always explain, document or specify the following aspects:

  * 3-5 central quality requirements, expressed in
  scenarios.
  * Context view and external interfaces
  * Brief explanation of your solution strategy, the most important decisions influencing the implementation or operation of the system.
  * Building block view, level 1.
  * Most important crosscutting concepts.
