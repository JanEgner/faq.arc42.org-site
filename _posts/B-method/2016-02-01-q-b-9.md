A whitebox contains multiple building blocks (blackboxes) with their relationships. It is a more detailed view of a blackbox
of a higher abstraction level. You find an example in the diagram below:

![]({{ site.imageurl }}/images/faq/B-Method/whitebox-sample.png){:width="30%"}.


This whitebox contains three blackboxes (A,B,C) and some relationships - a few of which are labelled.

Please consider using the "whitebox template" to explain your decisions: It is explained in [question B-11]().
