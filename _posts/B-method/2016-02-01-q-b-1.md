**Short answer**

: Please don't _fill in everything_. Document **only what your stakeholders need** (you should ask them, one-by-one).

**Longer answer**

: Everything you document will potentially require maintenance
effort in the future. With every piece of documentation, you're
effectively piling up maintenance debt - and in parallel creating some information value...

  Please only document things, facts and reasons that you
  or your stakeholders consider _important_ enough to justify
  written documentation.
