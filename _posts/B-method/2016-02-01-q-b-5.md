**Short answer**

: Both scope/context (arc42 section 3) and
building block view (arc42 section 5) provide adequate room
for external interfaces.

**Longer answer**

: How and where you describe external interfaces depends
on several factors:

  * If your system provides external interfaces to external
  consumers **and** you and your team can decide about
  any details of these interfaces - then you have to
  care for their documentation.
  * Do you need to provide external systems with information
  on _how to use_ your interfaces? You could provide
  example code and other interface documentation, but need
  to make sure this information is easily accessible to
  the external stakeholders.
  * Do you just provide _data_ at your external interfaces,
  and no services? Then you might stick to just a documentation of data formats (and maybe semantics).
  * In case you use interfaces provided by external systems,
  make sure their documentation is easily accessible by your
  development and maintenance teams. Include references in the arc42 context or building block view.
