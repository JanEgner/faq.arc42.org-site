#### Short answer

Create and update documentation continuously - in sync with your sprints
or iterations.



#### Longer answer

If you defer documentation to "later", I am reasonably sure it might never
be done. Don't procrastinate - but make (brief, short, compact, economical)
documentation a habit, like checking-in source code in version control
or writing automated tests (you test, don't you?).

  In my opinion it's way better to have short up-to-date and current
  documentation of only some aspects of the system, than to just have a plan
  to sometimes document the whole system...

  Reserve a brief period of time every day (or at least every week)
  to catch up with your documentation tasks. Close your door, your
  email reader and your messenger apps, flip your phone to silent mode... and
  jot down some important, interesting, risky or otherwise valuable information
  about your current topics.
