Use the context view to reference external systems' documentation or to provide references to the parts of your arc42 documentation containing appropriate information.

If an external system/interface is especially important or risky
for your architecture, it's sometimes adequate to _copy_
parts of this interface document into your own arc42...

Too bad the documentation of that (external) system was located on a network share... that was accidentally _down_ at the same time - so no developer could access the documentation that was essential to tackle the production bug...
