The building block view explains your source code in a hierarchical way:

The topmost level (level 1) represents the white box description of the overall
system, made up of black box descriptions of the systemâ€™s top level building blocks.

Level 2 zooms into the building blocks of Level 1 and is thus made up of the white box descriptions of all building blocks of Level 1 together with the black box descriptions of the building blocks of Level 2.

The following diagram shows a (rather generic) example - starting the hierarchical
decomposition from the context view (called level-0 in arc42 terms)
