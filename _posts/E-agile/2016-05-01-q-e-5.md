#### Short answer

Imagine you're a future stakeholder who then needs to work on the system (implement, architect, deploy, test, operate, monitor or other). Then ask yourself what information you need to have...

#### Longer answer

1. Explicitly create an overview of stakeholders (organizations, roles, people) for your system.
2. Ask representatives of every stakeholder group about their needs and wishes about architecture documentation
3. Prioritize their answers, add important stuff to your Definition-of-Done
4. Act accordingly during development
