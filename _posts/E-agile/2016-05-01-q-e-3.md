You have a plethora of options here - some examples:

* Less is often more. Keep documentation short and focussed. Don't try to explain the whole world.
* Prioritize: focus on important, interesting, special or risky topics, instead of striving for _completeness_.
* Document crosscutting concepts instead of many building blocks.
* Avoid too much detail: Use _abstractions_, especially in the building block
view and runtime view.
