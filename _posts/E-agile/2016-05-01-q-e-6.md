In theory, yes. In practice such a deferral means that this documentation will (quite likely) never ever be created - and stakeholders might need to dig deep into source code to gather the appropriate information at some later time.

We urge you - document economically (short, brief, compact and with as-low-as-possible effort), but do this continuously.
