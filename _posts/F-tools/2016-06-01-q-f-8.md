There a a few options to simplify the setup of the arc42 structure within your Confluence&reg;:

* The [Networked-Assets ATC macro](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.networkedassets.plugins.space-blueprint/server/overview) to insert the arc42 template into any Confluence&reg; space.
* The [smartics Blueprints for arc42](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.smartics.atlassian.confluence.smartics-projectdoc-confluence-arc42/server/overview)
* (Within the near future...) You can get a Confluence&reg; space generated out of the arc42 _Golden Master_ from the arc42-template github repository. We're currently working hard on making this available for download.

See [question F-9 (Diagrams in Confluence&reg;)](/questions/F-9) for an overview of diagramming tools available for Confluence&reg;.
