> I want to document in my own language, not in English. Is arc42 available in other languages?

As of October 2022, arc42 is available in the following languages:

* Czechian (CZ)
* Dutch (Netherlands, NL)
* English (EN)
* German (DE)
* Italian (IT)
* Spanish (ES)
* Ukrainian (UA)

In February 2022, due to the terrible war against the Ukraine, we completely dropped our support for the Russian version.
