The content of the arc42 template is maintained in AsciiDoc format in a
public Github repository - we try to follow a _single-source_ approach
(but currently don't succeed fully!)

1. We maintain one version for every supported language (currently German and English).
We call those the `Golden-Master`

2. `Golden-Master` versions contain both the template content plus the essential help information
(content, motivation and form).

3. From `Golden-Master` we generate a multitude of output formats by Gradle build scripts,
using a number of open source tools. One generated format is Microsoft&tm; "docx".

4. Some formats are maintained manually, as the automatic generation is either too bad
or would be too much effort to implement:

  * This FAQ website and the [arc42-documentation-site](http://docs.arc42.org) are
maintained manually... as we have no means of automatically
  * The "official" docx download is manually created from the generated version, as our generator
  lacks options for proper styling, useful pagebreaks and the table-of-contents.
  * Our Leanpub books are maintained manually
