#### Short answer

It depends: On one hand, homogeneity, consistency and standardization can be really useful and efficient for documentation, on the other hand can cost and effort for such standardized documentation become very high.   

#### Longer answer

Answer the following questions for your situation. The more "yes" answers the more useful a _regulated_ documentation might be:

* Do you have many (i.e. more than 15) IT-systems you develop or maintain?
* Do many of these systems have technical _similarities_ (use common frameworks, implementation approaches, technical concepts)?
* Do you work with different implementation or maintenance teams?
* Do you have a lot of change within your development team?
* Do different organizations work on your systems (i.e. external service providers)?
* Do you work in regulated domains (i.e. medicine, aerospace, pharmaceutics etc.)?
* Will the documentation of your systems be audited, validated or otherwise (formally) checked?
* Are some of your systems _highly critical_ for success or survival of your organization?
* Are your systems maintained by a large development team (>100 people)?
