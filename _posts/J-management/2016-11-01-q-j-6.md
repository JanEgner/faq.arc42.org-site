#### Short answer

Keep the administrative effort as low as possible: If you
accord details access permissions, you create administrative overhead.

#### Longer answer

Usually, all stakeholders can read and write the documentation. Some cases justify exceptions from this rule:

* For large teams, you should modularize your documentation and restrict write-access to certain parts, to avoid _accidental_ changes.

* You might differentiate (short-term) _project_ and (long-term) _system_ documentation. Everybody can write in project documentation, only few people might modify system documentation.
* In case of regulated documentation, you might need detailed permissions (and access logs) to avoid manipulation.
