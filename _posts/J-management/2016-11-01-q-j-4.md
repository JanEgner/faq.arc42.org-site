#### Counter question: What do you want to achieve with such a checklist?

Possible answers:

##### Improve the content of the documentation?

You won't get that by a checklist, but only by good examples, coaching and feedback.

##### Checking formal criteria?

Can you improve by checklists - but there's no general consensus on formal criteria. We suggest you refrain from overly formal criteria - as documentation won't get much more useful when it's formal.

##### Remind the team of some important parts of the documentation?

Determine the subset of arc42 that your stakeholders really need - and then include those in your _definition-of-done_ (see also [question E-2 ](/questions/E-2))
