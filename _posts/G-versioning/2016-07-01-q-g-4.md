Remark: a _variant_ can also mean a _preliminary version_.


**Short answer**

: It'll create additional effort to keep variants. Are you sure you
want to invest that? If the answer is "yes", use some kind of tagging
or labelling to distinguish between versions and variants.

**Long answer**

We have tried several options:

1.) You may attach some kind of markers or _stereotypes_ to your variants,
and _generate_ your documentation according to these stereotypes. Think of these
markers as labels or categories.

2.) In case you use a wiki system - some of those allow stereotypes or labels
on pages.

3.) You can keep variants in "modules", where you have some common parts,
and the variants as specialisations or addons of these common parts.
Have a look at [question J-1](/questions/J-1/), which covers _very large systems_, but replace _subsystems_ by _variants_.
