(remark: a _variant_ can also mean a _preliminary version_)

* You may attach some kind of markers or _stereotypes_ to your variants,
and _generate_ your documentation according to these stereotypes. Think of these markers as labels or categories.

* In case you use a wiki system - some of those allow stereotypes or labels
on pages.

* You can keep variants in "modules", where you have some common parts,
and the variants as specialisations or addons of these common parts.
Have a look at [question J-1](/questions/J-1/), which covers _very large systems_, but replace _subsystems_ by _variants_.
