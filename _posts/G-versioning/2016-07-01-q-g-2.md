One way which helped me several times is the following:

1. When you release your software (in continuous deployment scenarios, you might stick to major releases...), create a pdf file from your documentation.
2. Put this pdf under version control, in the same branch, tag/label or release info as your code-to-be-released.

### Don't accept a lack of version control!

**Really** (really!) make sure you find a (mostly automated) way to get your documentation under version control.
