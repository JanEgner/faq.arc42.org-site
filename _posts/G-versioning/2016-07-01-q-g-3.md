Although some tool vendors argue differently, recognizing the _meaning_ of differences between diagrams requires human intelligence:

I (Gernot) have not yet found any automatism supporting meaningful _diff_ of diagrams or images. In my opinion somebody needs to care for new versions of diagrams.

It can help (automatically) include the modification date in a diagram (some modeling tools support this feature).

In the diagram below you find an example - version notes
are shown in the upper left corner.
