(UML) ports, these little rectancular boxes attached to components, packages or even nodes,
represent an (optionally named) collection of interfaces. They come in handy for
several reasons:

#### Detailed mapping of 'inside to outside'

Ports can support the detailed mapping of internal resp. external view of white-
and blackboxes: Use ports to describe which _internal_ building block of any
whitebox communicates with an interface of the corresponding blackbox. In the following
diagram, Foo communicates with Bar over a port. In the refining whitebox,
the component BarA handles that interaction.

#### Transmission protocol

I (Gernot) often used ports to denote the transmission protocoll for a particular interface: For an interface (e.g. _inFoo_) I can show that its available over http, https and ftp by attaching the same interface ball/socket to several ports, each port representing a distinct "access option" (ftp, http, https)...

 Note: This is _not_ what the original inventors of UML intented...

#### Input-/Output

In hardware- and deployment diagrams, ports can represent input/output channels, network adapters, virtual networks, IP-addresses or similar .
