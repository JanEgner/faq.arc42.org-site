They don't really need each other. You can very well use arc42
with and without UML.

Graphical modelling with UML does by no means make you a better architect,
nor does it (automatically) improve your systems.

You might use UML to describe or specify the following aspects of your
architecture:

* static structure (building block view)
* runtime behavior or runtime scenarios (runtime view)
* deployment or infrastructure
* static or dynamic aspects of crosscutting concepts can sometimes be expressed in UML models.
