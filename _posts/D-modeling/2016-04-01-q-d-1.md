For cute, neat, small and mignion systems, you won't need any model.

For larger, distributed, risky or otherwise complicated systems, architectural
information in addition to source code can support both development and
evolution of systems.

_Models_ in our sense are arbitrary abstractions of architecture or
architecture decisions, relating to either structure or (crosscutting) concepts.

Examples of such _models_ we found useful:

* Context of the system, showing external neighbours and interfaces.
* Building blocks (e.g. subsystems, modules or such), representing potentially
large chunks of source code.
* Other views, e.g. runtime or deployment
* A domain model, representing the core of your domain.

Models can be expressed using diagrams plus explanations, but might also
be textual or tabular...

Btw: compare a sequence diagram generated from code with a (carefully) 
modeled one which only contains the most important abstract elements
(and not all detailed classes and methods).
