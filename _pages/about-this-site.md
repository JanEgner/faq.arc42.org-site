### Content
The content of this site is primarily based upon a Leanpub book on arc42, that contains an FAQ chapter. The questions in this book and on this website should be identical.

Both are written in Markdown, but not in a completely identical dialect, sigh... (see below for differences).

### Tooling
This page is based upon [Jekyll](), a static website generator, using the [TtskchTheme](https://github.com/ttskch/jekyll-ttskch-theme) theme.

It's maintained on Github - published via github-pages.

### Markdown and Jekyll

Some issues occured during the migration of questions from the Leanpub markdown:

##### Images

##### Crossreferences
