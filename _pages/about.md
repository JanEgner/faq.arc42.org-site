arc42 is a template for software architecture documentation and communication, answering
the following two questions in a pragmatic way:

* What should you document/communicate about your architecture?
* How should you document/communicate?

In addition, arc42 proposes many pragmatical, efficient, economical
simple solutions to _explain_ software architectures.

arc42 has been widely used in many organizations since 2005.


It has been developed by [Dr. Gernot Starke](http://gernotstarke.de) and [Dr. Peter Hruschka](http://b-agile.de). arc42 is maintained at [Github](https://github.com/arc42).
